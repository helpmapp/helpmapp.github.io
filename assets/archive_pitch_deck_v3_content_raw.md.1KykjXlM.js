Service availability is opaque, hours change daily, and capacity fills quickly. This leads to wasted time, missed opportunities for aid, and a cycle of disengagement. Meanwhile, service providers and local authorities lack the data to understand utilization and coordinate effectively. The problem is not a lack of services; it is a lack of connection.</p><p><strong>Key Data Points:</strong></p><ul><li>13,231 people sleeping rough in London (latest count).</li><li>Over 10,000 service slots across hundreds of fragmented providers.</li><li>60%+ of unhoused Londoners now have smartphone access.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="slide-3-helpmapp-is-the-solution-and-it-s-already-live" tabindex="-1">Slide 3: HelpmApp is the Solution, and It&#39;s Already Live <a class="header-anchor" href="#slide-3-helpmapp-is-the-solution-and-it-s-already-live" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Slide 3: HelpmApp is the Solution, and It&#39;s Already Live&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Heading:</strong> A Single, User-Friendly Platform to Find, Access, and Engage with Critical Services</p><p><strong>Content:</strong> HelpmApp is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) that aggregates verified support services onto a single, searchable map.

Users earn &quot;stars&quot; by checking in at services. These stars can be redeemed for essential items like free coffee, bus tickets, hot meals, phone credit, and hygiene kits. This creates a positive feedback loop: users are incentivized to engage with services, and each check-in generates anonymized data that helps providers and policymakers understand service utilization in real-time.</p><p><strong>Live Rewards Catalogue (5 Rewards Available):</strong></p><ul><li>Free Coffee (10 ⭐) - Sponsored by Local Cafes Association</li><li>Bus Ticket (15 ⭐) - Sponsored by Transport for London</li><li>Hot Meal (20 ⭐) - Sponsored by Community Kitchen</li><li>Phone Credit (25 ⭐) - Sponsored by Telecom Partners</li><li>Hygiene Kit (30 ⭐) - Sponsored by Healthcare Foundation</li></ul><hr><h2 id="slide-5-live-traction-demonstrates-product-market-fit" tabindex="-1">Slide 5: Live Traction Demonstrates Product-Market Fit <a class="header-anchor" href="#slide-5-live-traction-demonstrates-product-market-fit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Slide 5: Live Traction Demonstrates Product-Market Fit&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Heading:</strong> 270 Services Across All 32 London Boroughs – A 320% Increase from Initial Launch</p><p><strong>Content:</strong> The platform has grown significantly since its initial launch. The current database includes 270 verified services across all 32 London boroughs, covering 9 critical categories: Food, Shelter, Healthcare, Legal Aid, Mental Health, Addiction Support, Clothing, Employment, and General Support.

By leveraging the free tiers of Vercel (hosting), Supabase (database/auth), and Leaflet/OpenStreetMap (mapping), the platform has a near-zero marginal cost per user.
