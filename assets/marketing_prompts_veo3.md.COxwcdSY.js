As the camera tracks backwards, pedestrians walking past start to glitch and fade into semi-transparency—but instead of disappearing, they turn into &quot;ghost figures&quot; sitting in doorways, on benches, and leaning against bus stops. The street is suddenly revealed to be crowded with these invisible people. Lighting is sodium-vapour orange mixed with cold blue neon. 16mm film grain key.
