Executive Summary: A De-Risked Relaunch&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The HelpmApp team&#39;s decision to perform a &quot;clean-slate rebuild&quot; represents a strategic, de-risked approach to scaling a proven concept [1]. The core value proposition—connecting people experiencing homelessness with fragmented services through gamification and providing actionable data to stakeholders—remains highly compelling [2]. The new documentation suite is comprehensive, aligning the business model, operational roadmap, financial projections, and technical architecture around a single, focused goal: to secure £70,000 in Year 1 working capital to fund the relaunch and scale a world-class, privacy-first platform [3].</p><p>The primary strength of the current plan is the shift in the funding ask from development to <strong>market execution</strong>. With the technical rebuild planned internally, the £70,000 request is dedicated to high-impact areas: user acquisition, the rewards pool, and partnership development [3]. This significantly strengthens the pitch to funders, as they are investing in <em>growth</em> of a proven product, not <em>speculative development</em>.</p><h2 id="_2-strategic-alignment-and-market-position" tabindex="-1">2.
