HelpmApp is that infrastructure—a strategic, data-driven ecosystem we built to restore dignity, improve access to essential services, and provide the actionable data needed for a more effective, evidence-based response to homelessness. Our core mission is to leverage technology to create clearer, more reliable pathways for individuals seeking support, while simultaneously illuminating the systemic gaps that perpetuate cycles of instability.This document outlines the strategic rationale, operational plan, and social impact framework for the HelpmApp platform. We are seeking <strong>£70,000 in seed funding</strong> to scale our proven technology, expand our user base, and drive measurable, positive change for one of society&#39;s most vulnerable communities.We will begin by outlining the deep-seated and compounding nature of the problem that HelpmApp has been designed to solve.</p><h4 id="_2-0-the-problem-the-compounding-crises-of-homelessness-and-digital-exclusion" tabindex="-1">2.0 The Problem: The Compounding Crises of Homelessness and Digital Exclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-0-the-problem-the-compounding-crises-of-homelessness-and-digital-exclusion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.0 The Problem: The Compounding Crises of Homelessness and Digital Exclusion&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Effective intervention in the homelessness crisis requires moving beyond surface-level statistics to grasp the systemic failures, psychological trauma, and practical barriers that entrench individuals in cycles of instability. To build a meaningful solution, we must first understand the multifaceted nature of a challenge born from decades of under-investment and fragmented service delivery.</p><h5 id="a-rising-tide-of-visible-and-hidden-crises" tabindex="-1">A Rising Tide of Visible and Hidden Crises <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-rising-tide-of-visible-and-hidden-crises" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A Rising Tide of Visible and Hidden Crises&quot;">​</a></h5><p>The scale of homelessness in the UK is growing, placing unprecedented pressure on public services and charitable organizations. The official statistics, while stark, only reveal part of a much larger, often invisible, crisis.</p><ul><li><strong>Rising Rough Sleeping:</strong> In London alone, the CHAIN annual report for 2024/25 recorded that <strong>13,231 people</strong> were seen rough sleeping. This represents a 10% increase on the previous year, continuing an alarming upward trend.</li><li><strong>Temporary Accommodation Pressures:</strong> As of June 2025, <strong>132,410 households</strong> were living in temporary accommodation, a figure that includes <strong>172,420 children</strong> . This environment of constant instability has a devastating knock-on effect on health, education, and future life chances.</li><li><strong>The Hidden Crisis:</strong> Beyond official counts, research from Crisis highlights the immense challenge of &quot;hidden homelessness.&quot; Thousands of people are precariously housed, sofa-surfing with friends or family, or forced to stay in unsafe and exploitative situations with strangers simply to avoid sleeping on the streets.</li></ul><h5 id="a-system-of-trauma-not-support" tabindex="-1">A System of Trauma, Not Support <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-system-of-trauma-not-support" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A System of Trauma, Not Support&quot;">​</a></h5><p>Deep-rooted systemic failures exacerbate the crisis. Decades of under-investment in social housing have created a severe shortage of affordable homes, while evictions from the private rented sector remain a primary driver of homelessness. This forces vulnerable people into a fragmented and overwhelmed support system—a &quot;labyrinthine system,&quot; a term used not by academics, but by those with lived experience of its failings, who are often &quot;shunted from one service to the next rather than receiving the support they need.&quot;Furthermore, homelessness is both a cause and a consequence of significant trauma. Research shows that nearly nine out of ten people experiencing homelessness have suffered at least one adverse childhood experience, with rates of PTSD and complex PTSD (cPTSD) estimated to be as high as 53% and 60%, respectively. This creates complex support needs that many services are ill-equipped to handle, leading to a cycle of disengagement and worsening health outcomes. As one frontline service provider noted:&quot; <strong>There just isn’t enough of the right types of accommodation and support that would support people with complex needs available... burn out is a high risk.</strong> &quot;</p><h5 id="the-critical-challenge-of-digital-exclusion" tabindex="-1">The Critical Challenge of Digital Exclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-critical-challenge-of-digital-exclusion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Critical Challenge of Digital Exclusion&quot;">​</a></h5><p>In an increasingly digital-first world, the lack of reliable access to online information has become a critical barrier to exiting homelessness. The shift to online-only applications for benefits, housing, healthcare, and employment creates a severe digital divide. For an individual already grappling with trauma, facing a broken link, a confusing online form, or a closed service after an expensive journey is not a minor inconvenience; it is a profound setback that reinforces feelings of hopelessness and exclusion, actively working against their recovery. Without consistent access to a smartphone, data, or digital literacy, individuals are locked out of the very support pathways designed to help them.This analysis of a complex, interconnected problem creates a clear imperative for an innovative, technology-driven solution that can bridge these gaps.</p><h4 id="_3-0-our-solution-helpmapp-a-data-driven-ecosystem-for-dignity-and-support" tabindex="-1">3.0 Our Solution: HelpmApp - A Data-Driven Ecosystem for Dignity and Support <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-0-our-solution-helpmapp-a-data-driven-ecosystem-for-dignity-and-support" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.0 Our Solution: HelpmApp \\- A Data-Driven Ecosystem for Dignity and Support&quot;">​</a></h4><p>We built HelpmApp as a purpose-built, technology-driven ecosystem designed to directly address the challenges of service fragmentation, digital exclusion, and data scarcity within the homelessness sector. Its strategic value lies in its dual function: it empowers individuals with real-time, verified information to navigate the support system with dignity, while simultaneously equipping service providers and commissioners with the anonymized data required to make smarter, more responsive decisions.</p><h5 id="our-value-proposition-for-key-stakeholders" tabindex="-1">Our Value Proposition for Key Stakeholders <a class="header-anchor" href="#our-value-proposition-for-key-stakeholders" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Our Value Proposition for Key Stakeholders&quot;">​</a></h5><p>Stakeholder Group,Benefit Delivered,How HelpmApp Achieves This<br> People Experiencing Homelessness,&quot;Improved Access, Dignity &amp; Engagement:&quot;,&quot;Provides a single, reliable source of verified information, reducing wasted journeys to closed services and offering tangible rewards to encourage engagement with support pathways.&quot;<br> &quot;Service Providers (Charities, NGOs)&quot;,Enhanced Visibility &amp; Actionable Data:,&quot;Increases visibility of services to target users and provides real-time, anonymized utilization data to identify service gaps, optimize operations, and justify funding applications.&quot;<br> Local Authorities &amp; Commissioners,Evidence-Based Policy &amp; Commissioning:,&quot;Supplies borough-level data on service demand and cohort trends, enabling more efficient resource allocation and the commissioning of services based on demonstrated need rather than historical assumptions.&quot;</p><h5 id="core-technological-components" tabindex="-1">Core Technological Components <a class="header-anchor" href="#core-technological-components" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Core Technological Components&quot;">​</a></h5><p>The HelpmApp platform consists of four integrated components that work together to create a seamless experience for all stakeholders.</p><ol><li><strong>The User Application:</strong> The user-facing mobile app is the gateway to the ecosystem. It features an interactive map displaying verified support services, filterable service cards (e.g., by borough, service type), and real-time status updates, ensuring users have the most accurate information possible.</li><li><strong>The Gamified Rewards System:</strong> This is a key differentiator that fosters positive reinforcement and sustained engagement. By interacting with services, users can earn credits to redeem for tangible, essential items like hot meals, transport vouchers, or hygiene products from a central, grant-funded and corporate-sponsored Rewards Pool.</li><li><strong>The Provider Portal:</strong> A secure web portal allows verified service providers to easily manage their public listings, update their operational status in real-time (e.g., &quot;Open,&quot; &quot;At Capacity,&quot; &quot;Closed&quot;), and access a dashboard with their own service analytics.</li><li><strong>The Central Data Engine:</strong> The strategic core of the platform, our data engine aggregates and anonymizes all user interaction data. Powered by a robust geospatial database (Postgres with PostGIS), it generates powerful, location-aware insights into service demand, user flow, and systemic gaps, providing a macro-level view of the homelessness landscape for the first time.These components combine to create a solution that not only meets immediate needs but also aligns with the UK&#39;s broader strategic goals for ending homelessness.</li></ol><h4 id="_4-0-strategic-alignment-supporting-national-priorities-to-end-homelessness" tabindex="-1">4.0 Strategic Alignment: Supporting National Priorities to End Homelessness <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-0-strategic-alignment-supporting-national-priorities-to-end-homelessness" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4.0 Strategic Alignment: Supporting National Priorities to End Homelessness&quot;">​</a></h4><p>For any new initiative to be successful, it must align with established national policy and address recognized strategic priorities. HelpmApp is not a standalone project but a critical tool designed to accelerate the goals set forth in the government&#39;s &quot;A National Plan to End Homelessness&quot; and its focus on tackling digital exclusion.</p><h5 id="direct-alignment-with-national-homelessness-strategy" tabindex="-1">Direct Alignment with National Homelessness Strategy <a class="header-anchor" href="#direct-alignment-with-national-homelessness-strategy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Direct Alignment with National Homelessness Strategy&quot;">​</a></h5><p>HelpmApp&#39;s data-driven approach directly supports the core pillars of the national strategy, providing the practical infrastructure needed to turn policy into action.</p><ul><li><strong>A Shift Towards Early Intervention:</strong> The plan calls for a &quot;shift towards early intervention&quot; and the development of data-driven &quot;Prevention Toolkits&quot; for local councils. By providing granular, real-time data on service demand and user needs, HelpmApp provides the foundational evidence base required to identify risks earlier and design more effective preventative services.</li><li><strong>Person-Centred Support:</strong> HelpmApp&#39;s user-centric design empowers individuals with choice and agency, fulfilling the plan&#39;s mandate for &quot;person-centred support to prevent rough sleeping.&quot; It moves away from a one-size-fits-all approach by giving users the information they need to access the services that are right for them.</li><li><strong>Fostering Collaboration and Data Use:</strong> The platform acts as a shared digital infrastructure that enables collaboration between charities, community groups, and local authorities. This directly answers the government&#39;s directive to &quot;help councils make better use of data and evidence&quot; by creating a common, transparent data environment.</li><li><strong>Improving the Lived Experience:</strong> By providing clear, reliable information and reducing wasted, demoralizing journeys to closed services, the app directly contributes to the national goal of &quot;Improving households’ experience when living in temporary accommodation&quot; and on the streets.</li></ul><h5 id="positioning-within-the-tech-for-good-landscape" tabindex="-1">Positioning within the &#39;Tech for Good&#39; Landscape <a class="header-anchor" href="#positioning-within-the-tech-for-good-landscape" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Positioning within the &#39;Tech for Good&#39; Landscape&quot;">​</a></h5><p>The UK government has recognized the critical role of technology in solving social challenges. The creation of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology&#39;s (DSIT) <strong>Digital Inclusion Innovation Fund</strong> is clear evidence of a national priority to bridge the digital divide for vulnerable populations. HelpmApp is a prime example of a &#39;Tech for Good&#39; venture that delivers on this priority, offering a targeted, evidence-based digital inclusion intervention. HelpmApp is positioned to be a leading example within this landscape, aligning with the investment focus of entities like Social Tech Trust and the innovation priorities of Innovate UK, demonstrating a clear pathway from grant-funded pilot to sustainable social enterprise.This strong strategic alignment ensures that HelpmApp is not only solving a pressing problem but is also contributing directly to a recognized national agenda, making it a timely and vital investment.</p><h4 id="_5-0-theory-of-change-social-impact-measurement" tabindex="-1">5.0 Theory of Change &amp; Social Impact Measurement <a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-0-theory-of-change-social-impact-measurement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;5.0 Theory of Change &amp; Social Impact Measurement&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Our commitment to rigorous, evidence-based practice is absolute. Funders and investors increasingly expect a clear &quot;line of sight&quot; from spending to outcomes, and we designed HelpmApp from its inception with a robust social impact measurement framework at its core. Our Theory of Change articulates the causal pathway from our activities to the long-term social impact we aim to achieve.</p><h5 id="our-theory-of-change" tabindex="-1">Our Theory of Change <a class="header-anchor" href="#our-theory-of-change" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Our Theory of Change&quot;">​</a></h5><ul><li><strong>Inputs:</strong> We will leverage the requested <strong>£70,000 in funding</strong> , our existing and proven technology platform, and our strategic partnerships with frontline service providers.</li><li><strong>Activities:</strong> Our core activities will be onboarding and training service providers, acquiring users through a trusted, street-level model using peer advocates, and distributing tangible rewards for service engagement via the app.</li><li><strong>Outputs:</strong> These activities will produce direct, quantifiable results, including the total number of active monthly users, the number of verified services listed, and the total number and value of rewards redeemed by users.</li><li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The direct beneficiaries of our work will experience measurable change.
