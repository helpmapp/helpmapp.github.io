This is a record high, but it is just the tip of the iceberg. Crisis research indicates that for every visible rough sleeper, there are ~15 &quot;hidden homeless&quot;—people sofa-surfing, sleeping in cars, or in temporary accommodation.</p><p>These &quot;Inbetweeners&quot; (63% of whom are new to the streets) are digitally excluded from support. They possess smartphones but avoid traditional, stigmatised &quot;homeless services.&quot; As a result, they remain invisible to the system until they reach a crisis point, costing the state £20k+ per person/year in emergency interventions.</p><p>The current system relies on &quot;word of mouth&quot; in an era of rapid churn. Users travel miles to find a shelter that is full or closed. Providers operate with zero real-time data on demand, leading to massive inefficiencies. We are solving the &quot;Information Gap&quot; that keeps people on the streets.</p><h2 id="_2-what-is-your-solution-200-words" tabindex="-1">2. What is your solution?
